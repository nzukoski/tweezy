Tweezy taught me

Tweezy is a project for the 2013 Tartanhacks hackathon. Tweezy is a bird that loves to rap but isn't too original so once you give him a topic, he goes on twitter and finds tweets about that topic. Once tweezy has the rhyming tweets, he spits with his sick flow (i.e. emotionless text to speech).

The code here now is all from the 24 hour hackathon so is pretty hacky but I'm working on rebooting and retooling it. 

Instead of finding tweets live when a request comes in, the new tweezy will have a scraper that builds a database of tweets indexed by rhyme and meter. So when a request for a rap comes in, tweezy will just pull the tweets out of the database.

Some of the initial code to parse tweets is in the 15440 repo.
